
1. Hardware
Refers to the physical devices and infrastructure needed to run the DBMS, including:
Servers and storage devices
2. Software
The actual DBMS software that facilitates interaction between the database and its users. Examples are
Oracle, MySQLand Microsoft SQL Server
Handles tasks like data organization, query execution, and access control.
3. Data
Central to the DBMS. It is organized into:
User Data: The actual data stored in tables.
Metadata: Data about data, including schema, data types, relationships, etc.
Indexes: Structures for efficient data retrieval.
4. Database Schema
Defines the logical structure of the database for example tables.
5. Query Processor
Converts user queries (written in SQL or another language) into executable instructions for the DBMS.
6. Storage Manager
Handles how data is stored, retrieved, and updated in the database.


# Question 2
A relational database is a type of database that stores and organizes data into structured tables, where each table consists of rows which represent records and columns which represent fields
examples of relational databases:
MySQL - An open-source database widely used for web applications.
PostgreSQL - An open-source, advanced relational database system.
Oracle Database - A commercial, feature-rich database for enterprise applications.
Microsoft SQL Server - A relational database developed by Microsoft, commonly used in enterprise environments.

# Question 3
1. Data Definition Language- DDL commands are used to define, modify, and manage the structure of database objects.
2. Data Manipulation Language- DML commands are used to manipulate the data stored in database tables. 
3. Data Control Language- DCL commands are used to control access to the data and manage permissions within the database.

# Question 4
A primary key is a column (or set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each record while	a foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in a table that establishes a link to the primary key in another table.

# Question 5

An Entity-Relationship Diagram is a visual representation of the structure of a database, illustrating how entities (tables) are related to each other.

# Question 6
1. Relational databases enforce data integrity rules, such as primary and foreign keys, ensuring consistent and accurate data across tables.
2. They support Structured Query Language (SQL), which provides a standard way to query, update, and manage the database.
3. They allow concurrent access by multiple users while maintaining data consistency through transaction management and locking mechanisms.
4. Relational databases offer robust security features such as user authentication, role-based permission and encryption.

# Question 7
1. Numeric Data Types-Used to store numbers for mathematical operations.
2. String Data Types-Used to store textual data.
3. Date and Time Data Types-Used to store date and time values.
4. Boolean Data Type-Used to store TRUE or FALSE values.

# Question 8
Its purpose is to provide a structured,secure and efficient way to store, manage and retrieve data while ensuring integrity.
